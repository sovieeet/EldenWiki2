# EldenWiki2, proyect with Android Studio Kotlin
This is my first app using Kotlin in Android Studio to my subject-matter in the institute.
App features are it have a login with email and Google, create new user with Google or Email, using an database with Google Firebase, uses fragment in the main menu, consumes an internet API and have the ad banner test from Google Admob.
Its something humble but I'm happy because my app works fine.
